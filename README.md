<p align="center">
  This project was made to understand the world of authentication both how we can generate tokens and encrypt passwords and how we consume this on the client side and how we keep the user logged in.
  On the server side I use MongoDB to store data, bcrypt to encrypt password, jsonwebtoken to generate a JWT, express to create a server with node. On the client side I use React to make UI, react-cookie to save token in browser cookie and lucid-react to use icons for UI.
